# FunColorRandom - Interactive Linear Gradient Generator

## Overview
**FunColorRandom** is an interactive web application designed to create and customize linear gradients dynamically. Built as a front-end development exercise, this project provides an intuitive interface for generating, adjusting, and visualizing gradients based on custom colors and orientations.

## Features
- **Two Color Inputs**: Two input fields allow users to define the start and end colors (in hexadecimal format, e.g., `#FF5733` and `#33FF57`).
- **Orientation Control**: A range-type input slider adjusts the gradient angle in degrees interactively.
- **Random Generation**: The "Random" button dynamically generates a linear gradient with random colors, displayed in a div above the inputs.
- **Real-Time Preview**: The generated gradient is applied as a background to a div for immediate visual feedback.
- **Copy Code (In Progress)**: The "Copy Color" button extracts the gradient values in the format `linear-gradient(degree, color1, color2)` and displays them in a textarea (feature still under development).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styling, including the management of linear gradients.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for random generation, DOM manipulation, and input interactivity.
- **Git**: Version control and deployment on GitHub.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Enter or modify color values in the two color inputs (optional).
3. Adjust the gradient angle using the range slider.
4. Click "Random" to generate a random gradient with new colors.
5. Use "Copy Color" to retrieve the CSS gradient code in the textarea (currently being finalized).

## Project Purpose
This project aims to enhance front-end development skills, including JavaScript event handling, dynamic CSS styling, and building an interactive user interface. It also demonstrates a Git workflow for version tracking and code sharing.

## Current Status
- Random gradient generation is fully functional.
- The "Copy Color" feature is under development and will soon be completed for reliable CSS code extraction.

## Future Improvements
- Finalize the "Copy Color" function for accurate and convenient clipboard copying.
- Add options to customize intermediate gradient points (beyond two colors).
- Implement responsive design for an optimal mobile experience.
- Display the current angle value in real-time near the slider.
